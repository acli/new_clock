abstract: This script was designed to replace two Javascript-based
  chiming clocks that deliver time information from two different
  time systems, one that announces the passing of Western time by
  striking Westminster-style quarterly chimes (Li, 2018), and
  another that announces the passing of Eastern time by notifying
  the progression of night watches (as used c. 7–2c BC in ancient
  China) by striking documented sonic patterns that identify each
  watch. The new script takes care in preventing the two kinds of
  sonic notifications from interfering with each other. Future work
  includes making resource use more predictable.

message: The title and abstract of this code and my ORCid are the
  only things not listed elsewhere. These references are generated;
  files in the doc directory should be considered more definitive.
