abstract: This script was designed to replace two Javascript-based
  chiming clocks that deliver time information from two different
  time systems. In addition to Westminster-style quarterly chimes,
  between sundown and sunrise it also sounds chimes that allow the
  current night watch (according to the proportional decimal time
  system in use c. 7–2c BC in the geographical region now known as
  China) to be sonically identified. Care is taken to avoid the two
  kinds of chimes from running together.
