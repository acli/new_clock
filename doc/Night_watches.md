Night watches
=============
The Chinese night watch system was originally derived
from the proportional decimal hour system
that was in use during the Shang era.
These proportional hours had names:

- daytime hours: morning, forenoon, midday, afternoon, evening
  (ˈdziu, ˌjy (?), ˈdzuŋ, ˈbou, ˍdzik)
- nighttime hours: A, B, C, D, E
  (ˉgap, ˍjyt, ˊbiŋ, ˈdiŋ, ˍmou)
  (no kidding)

In this system, the five night watches, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(ˈjɐtˈgaŋ, ˍjiˈgaŋ, ˈsamˈgaŋ, ˉseiˈgaŋ, ˏŋˈgaŋ),
were the hours A, B, C, D and E.

Each watch was subdivided into five equal parts
which we could call subwatches.
The beginnings of these five subwatches were called
points, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(ˈjɐtˊdim, ˍjiˊdim, ˈsamˊdim, ˉseiˊdim, ˏŋˊdim).

The system was later realigned to modern duodecimal hour boundaries,
but it’s superfluous to announce night watches of this later kind
if we’re already sounding Westminster-style chimes.
This is why this script follows the older, original system.
(Also, it’s useful to know “it’s now sundown”, etc.)

This script uses chimes that follow the patterns described by
[the Wikipedia article for Chinese night watches](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/打更):

- 1st watch: long, short (struck 3 times)
- 2nd watch: short, short (struck 2 times)
- 3rd watch: long, short, short (struck 3 times)
- 4th watch: long, short, short, short (struck 4 times)
- 5th watch: long, short, short, short, short (struck 5 times)

All these except the first follow a pattern; the first is different
clearly because striking a gong once is too easy to miss,
so they used a pattern that didn’t fit.
The odd one out is the first watch.
