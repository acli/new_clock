Night watches
=============
The Chinese night watch system was originally derived
from the proportional decimal hour system
that was in use during the Shang era
(when the five hours of the night were simply called A, B, C, D, and E).

The system was later realigned to modern duodecimal hour boundaries,
but it’s superfluous to announce these later kind of night watches
if we’re already sounding Westminster-style chimes.
This is why this script follows the older, original system.

This script uses chimes that follow the patterns described by
[Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/打更):

- 1st watch: — . (struck 3 times)
- 2nd watch: . . (struck 2 times)
- 3rd watch: — . . (struck 3 times)
- 4th watch: — . . . (struck 4 times)
- 5th watch: — . . . . (struck 5 times)

All these except the first follow a pattern; the first is different
clearly because striking a gong once is too easy to miss,
so they used a pattern that didn’t fit.
The odd one out is the first watch.
