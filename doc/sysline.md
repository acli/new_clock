The sysline beep is surprisingly difficult to synthesize as a MIDI note.
(It would be fairly easy to synthesize it if I can figure out how
to interface with SuperCollider on my Pulseaudio-based system.)
The closest standard instrument might be the open triangle (percussion note 81).

The following non-standard instruments seem to be promising:

- MuseScore General (Collins, n.d.), Orchestra Kit (128-048), note 33
