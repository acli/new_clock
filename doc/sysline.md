The sysline beep is surprisingly difficult to synthesize as a MIDI note.
(It would be fairly easy to synthesize it if I can figure out how
to interface with SuperCollider on my Pulseaudio-based system,
but none of the electronic instruments that I’ve tried sounds like it.)
The closest standard instrument might be the open triangle (standard percussion note 81).

The following non-standard instruments seem to be promising:

- MuseScore General (Collins, n.d.), Orchestra Kit (128-048), note 33
  - An analog “ding” sound
- Timbres of Heaven (Allen, n.d.) or MuseScore General (Collins, n.d.), Sine Wave (008-080), note 70 or 82
  - A fairly convincing digital “beep” if we keep the note short (need to send a noteoff), at in theory 440 or 880 Hz
  - Note 84 would be closer to 1000 Hz, at theoretically about 988 Hz
  - Timbres of Heaven, C64 Pulse (101-000), C64 Saw (101-001), C64 Triangle (101-002) and Echo Pan (002-102) appear to work too
