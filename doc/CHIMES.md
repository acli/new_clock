Chime options
=============
Unlike Javascript (or Python), there is no native support in Perl to process audio.
The script currently uses [mpv](http://mpv.io) to play audio recordings,
and multiple copies of mpv are needed to play a chime melody.
This is clearly not ideal since resource usage is unpredictable
so thereâ€™s both a danger of thrashing and audio distortion.

Gong options
------------
https://freesound.org/people/strangehorizon/packs/32761/
- pros: the whole scale, public domain (cc0)
- cons: need lots of mpv subprocesses to play chime melodies

Bell options
------------
We can use gongs, but it sounds a little off

https://www.fluidsynth.org/
- pros: one subprocess only for each sink
- cons: if we have more than one sink configured, running two copies of fluidsynth at the same time will cause massive distortion.
  It might be possible to pre-generate a sound file and then use mpv to play that pregenerated file when an event fires.
- fluidsynth numbers seem to be off by one in bank 0, 0-14 is tubular bells, 8-14 is church bells (doesn't really work, it strikes twice)

https://freesound.org/people/sandyrb/packs/6993/
- pros: fairly clear, cc-by-3.0, Canadian
- cons: possibly too loud (possible distortion), 15-semitone range not enough for Westminster chimes

https://freesound.org/people/Samulis/packs/21054/
- pros: very clear, public domain (cc0)
- cons: not enough range (only 4 notes)

https://freesound.org/people/Samulis/packs/12231/
- pros: very clear, cc-by-3.0, little to no distortion even with the f (loud) samples
- cons: not enough range in version on Freesound
  (will investigate full [VSCO library on main site](https://vis.versilstudios.com/vsco-community.html))

Chime melody options
