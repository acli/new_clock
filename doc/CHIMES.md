Gong options
============
https://freesound.org/people/strangehorizon/packs/32761/
- pros: the whole scale, public domain (cc0)
- cons: need lots of mpv subprocesses to play chime melodies

https://www.fluidsynth.org/
- pros: one subprocess only for each sink
- cons: if we have more than one sink configured, running two copies of fluidsynth at the same time will cause massive distortion.
  It might be possible to pre-generate a sound file and then use mpv to play that pregenerated file when an event fires.
- fluidsynth numbers seem to be off by one in bank 0, 0-14 is tubular bells, 8-14 is church bells (doesn't really work, it strikes twice)

============
using MIDI drum kit:
- 31 (sticks)
- 60 (high bongo)
