SrWilson [Steve]. (2005, February 12). The actual melody which became later known as the whittington chimes is much older than
the westminster chimes [Forum post].  Retrieved from https://mb.nawcc.org/threads/when-did-the-whittington-chime-get-developed.17426/
- Originally called the “chime on 8 bells”
- Dates from at least the 1700’s
- The name “Whittington” started to take off around 1900

- Whittington was originally a 6-bell chime, later became an 8-bell one
- St Mary Le Bow is the only place in the world that has an 11-bell version (11-bell for the whole composition, but not for any quarter)
