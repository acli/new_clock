abstract: This script was designed to replace two Javascript-based
  chiming clocks that deliver time information from two different
  time systems, one that announces the passing of Western time by
  striking Westminster-style quarterly chimes (Li, 2018), and
  another that announces the passing of Eastern time by notifying
  the progression of night watches, as used c. 7â€“2c BC in ancient
  China, by striking documented sonic patterns that identify each
  watch. The new script takes care in avoiding the two kinds of
  sonic notifications from running into each other. Future work
  includes making resource use more predictable.
