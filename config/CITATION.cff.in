abstract: This script was designed to replace two Javascript-based
          chiming clocks that deliver time information from two
          different time systems, one that announces the passing
          of Western time by striking Westminster-style quarterly
          chimes, and another that announces the passing of Eastern
          time by calling out night watches (as used c. 7â€“2c BC in
          ancient China) using documented sonic patterns that identify
          each watch.  The new script takes care in preventing the two
          kinds of sonic notifications from interfering with each other.
          Future work includes making resource use more predictable.

  files in the doc directory should be considered more definitive.
