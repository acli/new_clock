abstract: This script was designed to replace two Javascript-based
  chiming clocks that deliver time information from two different
  time systems, one that strikes Westminster-style quarterly chimes
  [Li, 2018], and another that outputs notifications that allow
  the current night watch (according to the proportional decimal
  time system in use in ancient China c. 7â€“2c BC) to be sonically
  identified. Care is taken to avoid the two kinds of chimes from
  running together.
