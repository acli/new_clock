This script sounds [English-style chimes (Westminster, Whittington and others)](doc/CHIMES.md) every quarter hour.
Between sundown and sunrise,
it also sounds chimes every 1/5 of a [Chinese night watch](doc/Night_watches.md) (0.2 proportional decimal hours)
using traditional chiming patterns for night watches and
according to the old rule of one night watch equalling one decimal hour.

(I’ve tried to make some effort to prevent
the two kinds of chimes from clashing with each other.
Unfortunately this is not working.)

Certain runtime parameters can be configured through a [per-user config file](doc/chimerrc.example),
currently hard-coded to be $HOME/.chimerrc

Aims
----
This was hacked together to replace my two Javascript chiming clocks,
with the aims of avoiding using Firefox for clock chimes
and reducing sound distortion issues caused by RTP broadcasts.

Status
------
This is still a work-in-progress but is already usable.
The current tested configuration is `method = synth`
(the synth is only used for pre-generating sound files)
with `mode = carillon`.

All carillon melodies except the studies should work;
this includes `westminster` (Westminster Quarters),
`whittington` (traditional 8-bell Whittington chimes),
and various melodies documented by Starmer (1907, 1910)
including `whittington11` (the Bow version of Whittington chimes composed by Charles Villiers Stanford in 1905,
as transcribed by Starmers, 1907, p. 5).
You can also try `study2` or `study3`,
which are based on Starmer’s (1910, p. 97) description of “continental” chiming that divides the hour into eight parts.

`cuckoo` mode should work but doesn’t quite work correctly;
the cause is still to be found.

At some point it should ultimately serve as the back-end of my genmon plugin that shows Chinese (and Hebrew) dates.

Running
-------
The script currently only runs on a PulseAudio-based Linux system.
You also must have mpv and ffmpeg installed (see Dependencies below).

If you’re not running directly from a git clone,
you only need the script itself.

The best way to get sound working is to use Fluidsynth
with a copy of Timbres Of Heaven installed.
You also must have a `data` directory created to hold cached audio files.
Please see the [sample config file](doc/chimerrc.example).


Dependencies
------------
- [Pulseaudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/)-based Linux system
- [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) 5 with Unicode support (version 5.14 or later)
- [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv)
  to play audio samples
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
  if you use cuckoo mode
  (see [my comments about ffmpeg](doc/ffmpeg.md))
- [hebcal](https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal)
  to guess geographical location
  (not needed if you specify your geographical location in the config file)
- [DateTime::Event::Sunrise](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime::Event::Sunrise),
  [DateTime::Astro::Sunrise](https://metacpan.org/release/RKHILL/DateTime-Astro-Sunrise-0.01_01),
  or [Astro::Sunrise](https://metacpan.org/pod/Astro::Sunrise),
  to calculate sunrise and sundown
  (not all three are equally tested)
