This script is a work-in-progress that is replacing my two Javascript chiming clocks.
The main aims are to avoid using Firefox for clock chimes,
and to reduce sound distortion issues caused by RTP broadcasts.

At some point it should ultimately serve as the back-end of my genmon plugin that shows Chinese (and Hebrew) dates.

Sound files
-----------
I’ve decided to not check in any of the sound files because they are too large.
Please get them yourself from the links listed in the CREDITS file,
place the wav files in the “raw” directory and run make to generate the mp3 files.
(mpv must be installed.)
