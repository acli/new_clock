This script is a work-in-progress that is replacing my two Javascript chiming clocks.
The main aims are to avoid using Firefox for clock chimes,
and to reduce sound distortion issues caused by RTP broadcasts.

At some point it should ultimately serve as the back-end of my genmon plugin that shows Chinese (and Hebrew) dates.
